# INFO
# i= the focus id you need not need to put "TAG_focus_" as it will be done automatically
# p= focus prerequisit, do note it can only handle one prerequisit if there is no prerequisit, just put a "0" there and delete it yourself
# g= focus icon, if you dont have gfx, put a placeholder there
#
# IMPORTANT
# this script automatically puts "relative_position_id" as it is better than not having it and paradox agrees
# as they use it, also it makes life easier for future devs who wants to rework or change or move some stuff
# around to make it neater
# for those of you who don't know what "relative_position_id =" is, what it does is that focuses locaiton 
# would be based off the focus that you put in and off set it with the x = and y =
