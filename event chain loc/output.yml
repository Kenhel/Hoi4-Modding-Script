    SER_saint_andrew_day.1.d:0 "After the growing hostility against the prince, he had no choice but to meet the demands of the opposition. On the 30th of November, 1858 in Belgrade, the Saint Andrews Assembly was convened. After the Members had been seated, the Secretaries took their places in the upper part of the Chamber, under the Chair tables. At the same time, three priest-deputies consecrated the hall. Shortly thereafter the members of the Council, led by Tom Vucic Perisic, entered the assembly. Knyaz Alexander came accompanied by ministers and his retinue. The Knyaz addressed the assembly with "God help me, Lord", and the assembly responded with "God help you, Lord". The knyaz then announces to the congregation that his leader will read her the prepared sermon. The sermon was read by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ljubomir Petrovich. After reading the sermon, the knyaz declared the assembly open, and withdrew, accompanied by ministers and the world.The Assembly decided that the Prince should resign. A letter was written to the knyaz in which the Assembly, on behalf of the people, asked the Prince to resign the dignity of Prince of Serbia and to hand over his power to the National Assembly. ". . . The National Assembly hopes," the letter reads, "that your Majesty will respect this voice of your people, and for the love of the happiness, peace and tranquillity of our and your fatherland, will voluntarily renounce the Government, so that in 1842 . The National Assembly has handed over the government to you, so that you, the Holy Prince, may return it to the Assembly and through it to the people... "Together with this letter was enclosed the resignation which the Prince was to sign, and both acts were taken to court by a deputation of the Assembly headed by him. The Prince accepted the deputation and asked to come tomorrow morning after his resignation. That evening, however, the knyaz , accompanied by Ilija Garashanin, left for the city of Belgrade, and the assembly, without waiting for his written resignation, excluded him by one decision from the princely dignity."

    SER_saint_andrew_day.2.d:0 "At the St. Andrew's Day Assembly, the largest single group of representatives was formed by the alliance of the liberals with the partisans of the Obrenovic dynasty. While the former were young intellectuals, educated at the greatest European universities, the latter were mainly peasants and village traders; while the liberals believed in pan slavism and parliamentarism, the Obrenovic partisans were simply nostalgic for the days of a heavy-handed monarch who was benevolent towards the peasants. Whatever the differences, both shared the conviction of the necessity of a dynastic change and the desire for a stronger role of the Assembly in the future Serbian political life."

However, as time passed, the liberals were forced to compromise with the resistance of the old Councillors against the project and the anxiety of the dynastic partisans to return the throne to Prince Miloš. The law that was effectively promulgated from that compromise"
