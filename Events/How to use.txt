How to use

create a txt file in the same folder as the python script named "input.txt"

start the file with "prefix=", just put whatever prefix your events are using, which could be SPQ_pol_focus

after that on the next line, start with the event name, it does not need to be capitalised, the script automatically does that for you,

add the amount of options the event has in next line, see the sample_input.txt as reference

there is also implicit option amount, basically using the sample_input.txt as reference, you can see the last 2 lines without any option number. In this case, the script will assume the amount of options to be 1
